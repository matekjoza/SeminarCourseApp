# SeminarCourseApp

This Web application was made as a part of ASP.NET programming course. It is an ASP.NET WebForms app made using Visual Studio 2015.
App gives it's guest users list of seminar courses, and every user can register for specific course of choice by giving some basic information about him/herself.

In Admin section, authorized user (admin) can manipulate and edit information about each course, process each guest user application, and accept or reject it. Admin can also add new course or delete existing course.

I'm just a beginner in .NET, so forgive me if there are any bugs, or illogicality in code.

Code is entirely open sourced and I hope somebody will use it ;)
