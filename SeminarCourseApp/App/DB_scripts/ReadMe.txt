Here are SQL scripts for database and tables creation.

There are 3 tables in "Algebra" database: "Seminar", "Predbiljezba" and "AspNetUsers".

You can run these scripts in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, and connect the application to newly created database, so that application could work.

I used Connection String "cnnSeminar" for database connection using ADO.NET Entity Framework (EDM).
